# SKIN_CANCER_OPTIMISATION_MAX-VOTING
Skin cancer, a prevalent and life-threatening condition, necessitates early and precise diagnosis for effective treatment. Accurate
differentiation between various skin cancer types, each with distinct characteristics, is crucial for successful management.
Recent advancements in imaging techniques, such as dermoscopy, have significantly improved the early detection of skin
lesions by providing high-resolution images. Despite these advancements, distinguishing between benign and malignant
tumors through image analysis remains challenging, with current diagnostic methods often yielding inconsistent and inaccurate
results. To address these challenges, this study focuses on enhancing skin cancer prediction by leveraging an ensemble model
that integrates multiple machine learning (ML) techniques. We introduce a novel Max Voting ensemble approach designed
to optimize classification performance by combining the strengths of different ML models while mitigating their individual
weaknesses. The study utilizes the HAM10000 dataset to train and evaluate three distinct ML models: Random Forest (RF),
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The Max Voting method aggregates
predictions from these models, resulting in a notable improvement in overall performance. Additionally, image data feature
vectors for the ML models are optimized using a Genetic Algorithm to further enhance classification accuracy. Our results
demonstrate that the Max Voting approach significantly boosts performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.41%, and proves
to be the most reliable and robust method among the tested techniques. This research underscores the effectiveness of
combining multiple pre-trained ML models through the Max Voting strategy, offering a substantial advancement in the automatic
classification of skin cancer lesions and contributing to more accurate and consistent diagnostic outcomes.
